# The Chip-8 Emulator

This is a project I've wanted to tackle for almost a year now, but I never felt like I was up to the 
task of actually understanding what I was doing.  I've never really done any emudev before so I'm looking
forward to getting into it and really seeing how this thing works.

I wrote this myself in C using SDL for the graphics.  I read through a lot of github repos to get an idea of 
how this thing really works and I'll credit those as such
